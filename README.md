## My process
I first started with the html and added all components needed such as the image, caption, and information. I then went on to the css and strarted in the heirarchy starting with body.
Before this however I used a CSS reset from Andy bell so that I could freely edit the page.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this project I learned how to center my divs properly and also how to utilize flexbox as a tool to move items around. I also learned how to incorporate fonts in my HTML
as well as use the appropriate units for font sizing. 

### Continued development

I want to continue learning how to display things with html and css and manage them in order to make it look more readable and organized. 



### Useful resources

- [Discord]() - The discord helped me a lot as it provided feedback pretty fast on questions I had.
